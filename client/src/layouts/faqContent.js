        <b>FAQ</b>
      </h4>
      <br />
      <b>How do I return or exchange an item?</b> <br />
      <br /> To initiate a return, please submit a request for a Return
      Authorization Request (RAR) through your My Classy Threads account.
      Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care team to assist you with
      the return process. We adhere to a strict no-paper policy, so as to reduce
      waste. This is why shipments do not include a return slip inside the box.{" "}
      <br />
      <br />
      We do not process direct exchanges. We ask that you return the
      merchandise/products for a full refund and place a new order for the
      preferred item(s) within 7 business days from the time your order has been
      delivered to you. Returns are subject to our Return Policy. <br />
      <br /> Guest Orders: If an order was placed using the guest check out
      option, please create an My Classy Threads account to request and manage
      the return yourself. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care team
      to help facilitate the return.
      <br /> <br /> <b>How can I cancel or modify my order once placed?</b>{" "}
      <br /> <br />
      Modifying or cancelling an order is possible so long as the merchandise or
      products have not yet entered the packaging or shipment phases. <br />{" "}
      <br /> Please send us an email immediately, if the order has not been
      shipped or packed yet, we would be able to cancel or assist you with
      modification. Note: Modification of products or merchandise such as size
      or color changes is only possible if the required item is available in
      stock, and subject to availability. <br /> <br /> Please contact
      our customer care team if you do not have an account created yet with us
      and would like to make changes to an existing order. Our 24/7 Customer
      Care team will help facilitate any changes before the order enters the
      shipping queue. <br /> <br /> Please note:{" "}
      <i>
        if an order was placed using the guest check out option, you must create
        a My Classy Threads account to modify the order yourself. If you do not
        wish to create an My Classy Threads account, you can always contact
        our Customer Care team for assistance in modifying the order.

      <br /> <br /> <b>When will I receive my order?</b>
      <br /> <br /> Once your purchase has been completed, an e-mail
      confirmation will be sent to the email address that we have on file for
      you. This e-mail acts as an invoice and includes your order number.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our standard order processing time is up to two business days. However, we
      may need a little more time to process your orders during peak periods.
      <br />
      <br /> Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an e-mail with
      your shipment’s tracking information, allowing you to keep tabs on the
      progress of your delivery alongside with carrier details for your
      reference.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>How do I know the item will fit me? Or how does the item fit?</b>{" "}
      <br /> <br />
      In order to help find the best fit, the following information is available
      on every product page:
      <br /> 1. A size conversion chart to help convert sizes.
      <br /> 2. Product-specific measurements (i.e., sleeve length, pant leg
      width etc.).
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Is GST/taxes included?</b>
      <br /> <br />
      <b>GST/Taxes</b> <br />
      <br />
      The prices listed on individual product pages are calculated without GST
      or any taxes. In order to ensure you’re seeing the most accurate pricing
      excluding GST and delivery fees while you browse. Taxes/GST and Shipping
      fees if any will be calculated at the checkout page based on your product
      category and order value accordingly.
