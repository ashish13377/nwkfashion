      FAQ How do I return or exchange an item? To initiate a return, please
      submit a request for a Return Authorization Request (RAR) through your My
      Classy Threads account. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer
      Care team to assist you with the return process. We adhere to a strict
      no-paper policy, so as to reduce waste. This is why shipments do not
      include a return slip inside the box. We do not process direct exchanges.
      We ask that you return the merchandise/products for a full refund and
      place a new order for the preferred item(s) within 7 business days from
      the time your order has been delivered to you. Returns are subject to
      our Return Policy. Guest Orders: If an order was placed using the guest
      check out option, please create an My Classy Threads account to request
      and manage the return yourself. Alternatively, you can contact our
      Customer Care team to help facilitate the return. How can I cancel or
      modify my order once placed? Modifying or cancelling an order is possible
      so long as the merchandise or products have not yet entered the packaging
      or shipment phases. Please send us an email immediately, if the order has
      not been shipped or packed yet, we would be able to cancel or assist you
      with modification. Note: Modification of products or merchandise such as
      size or color changes is only possible if the required item is available
      in stock, and subject to availability. Please contact our customer care
      team if you do not have an account created yet with us and would like to
      make changes to an existing order. Our 24/7 Customer Care team will help
      facilitate any changes before the order enters the shipping queue. Please
      note: if an order was placed using the guest check out option, you must
      create a My Classy Threads account to modify the order yourself. If you do
      not wish to create an My Classy Threads account, you can always contact
      our Customer Care team for assistance in modifying the order. When will I
      receive my order? Once your purchase has been completed, an e-mail
      confirmation will be sent to the email address that we have on file for
      you. This e-mail acts as an invoice and includes your order number. Our
      standard order processing time is up to two business days. However, we may
      need a little more time to process your orders during peak periods. Once
      your order has been shipped, you will receive an e-mail with your
      shipment’s tracking information, allowing you to keep tabs on the progress
      of your delivery alongside with carrier details for your reference. How do
      I know the item will fit me? Or how does the item fit? In order to help
      find the best fit, the following information is available on every product
      page:  A size conversion chart to help convert sizes.  Product-specific
      measurements (i.e., sleeve length, pant leg width etc.). The above can be
      found in the ‘View Size Chart’ tab on any item’s product page. Our
      Customer Care team is always available to answer any questions regarding
      measurements and fitting. Is GST/taxes included? GST/Taxes The prices
      listed on individual product pages are calculated without GST or any
      taxes. In order to ensure you’re seeing the most accurate pricing
      excluding GST and delivery fees while you browse. Taxes/GST and Shipping
      fees if any will be calculated at the checkout page based on your product
      category and order value accordingly.
