      features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Platform
      to make your experience safer and easier.
      <br />
      <br />
      In general, you can browse the Platform without telling us who you are or
      revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your
      personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we
      indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You
      always have the option to not provide information, by choosing not to use
      a particular service or feature on the Platform. We may track your buying
      behavior, preferences, and other information that you choose to provide on
      our Platform. We use this information to do research on our user’s
      demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our
      users. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
      This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this
      URL is on our Platform or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL
      is on our Platform or not), your computer browser information, and your IP
      address. We will also collect your information related to your
      transactions on Platform. When such a third-party business partner
      collects your personal information directly from you, you will be governed
      by their privacy policies. We shall not be responsible for the third-party
      business partner’s privacy practices or the content of their privacy
      policies, and we request you to read their privacy policies prior to
      disclosing any information. If you set up an account or transact with us,
      we may seek some additional information, such as billing address,
      credit/debit card number and a credit/debit card expiration date and/ or
      other payment instrument details and tracking information from cheques or
      money orders to provide services, enable transactions or to refund for
      cancelled transactions. If you choose to post messages on our message
      boards, personalized messages, images, photos, gift card message box, chat
      rooms or other message areas or leave feedback/product review or if you
      use voice commands to shop on the Platform, we will collect that
      information you provide to us. Please note such messages posted by you
      will be in public domain and can be read by others as well, please
      exercise caution while posting such messages, personal details, photos and
      reviews. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes,
      provide customer support, internal research and troubleshoot problems as
      permitted by law. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails
      or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence
      about your activities or postings on the Platform, we may collect such
      information into a file specific to you. While you can browse some
      sections of our Platform without being a registered member, certain

      your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders
      or preferences and your interests. If you receive an e-mail, a call from a
      person/association claiming to be from My Classy Threads or its affiliates
      seeking sensitive personal information like debit/credit card PIN,
      net-banking or mobile banking password, we request you to never provide
      such information. We at My Classy Threads or our affiliate logistics
      partner do not at any time connect with you requesting for such
